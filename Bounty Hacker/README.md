Bounty Hacker WriteUp
=====================

[March 14, 2021](https://jarrodrizor.com/bounty-hacker-writeup/ "8:12 pm") [Jarrod](https://jarrodrizor.com/author/jarrod/ "View all posts by Jarrod")

This is a WriteUp on how to complete the room [Bounty Hacker](https://tryhackme.com/room/cowboyhacker) on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

Note* I used Parrot OS to complete this room. The IP address of my room was 10.10.192.66, so that will be the IP you see in the writeup. Replace 10.10.192.66 with the IP of your target box.

First, we are tasked with deploying the VM. Let's click Start Machine and we can get onto the next part.

Nmap
====

We need to find what ports are opened. We can do this by running the following command.

**nmap -sV -sC -v -oN BountyHacker_nmap 10.10.192.66**

How this works:\
nmap -- The command used to execute Nmap.\
-sV -- This means Nmap will run a service/version detection scan. These scans can take a while to run, but they return information about what services are running on each open port and what version they are.\
-v -- Tells Nmap to run verbose and display output on your screen while it's running.\
-sC -- This will tell Nmap to run a default script scan.\
-oN BountyHacker_nmap -- This means we want to save the output to a file named BountyHacker_nmap.

The important output we should see shows

21/tcp open ftp\
22/tcp open ssh\
80/tcp open http

If we navigate to the website on port 80 it just displays a basic web page with a banner of the Bebop crew and some funny dialogue exchange below it.

FTP Anonymous Login
===================

The next thing we will try is getting into the server using FTP as an Anonymous user. In our terminal, we will type FTP and the IP we want to connect to. Then when prompted we will put in anonymous as the user.

That seems to work, and running the command **ls -l** shows two files. A locks.txt and a task.txt. We can pull them to our machine using the FTP **get** command so we can read them on our machine.

The output from the file locks.txt displays a long list of passwords that have gone through some munging. Munge stands for Modify Until Not Guessed Easily.

The output from the file task.txt displays a message from Lin.

This brings us to answer the next question!

Who wrote the task list?\
Answer -- Lin

Moving onto the last port that was open is port 22. Using the new password list we have and a user to try, let's see if we can SSH into the server.

Hydra
=====

Hydra is a very useful tool when we want to guess passwords. In this case, we are going to try and use a brute force attack since we have a list of passwords to use.

**Command Used: hydra -l lin -P locks.txt ssh://10.10.192.66\
**\
How this works:\
hydra -- The command used to execute Hydra.\
-l -- This is the user we want to use to authenticate.\
-P -- The wordlist we want to use when guessing passwords.\
The last parameter is the target IP and using SSH protocol.

Running this command displays the password for the user Lin!

This allows us to answer the next few questions.

What service can you brute force with the text file found?\
Answer -- SSH

What is the users password?\
Answer -- RedDr4gonSynd1cat3

Sudo
====

Now we can ssh into the server using the command **ssh -l lin 10.10.192.66** and provide the password we got from Hydra RedDr4gonSynd1cat3.

Now that we are in, we can **ls -la** and find the user.txt file and other files that may be of some use. We can also **cat** out the user.txt and claim that flag.

user.txt\
Answer -- THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}

The next thing we should try is to see what commands Lin can run as a superuser. Running **sudo -l** shows us that Lin has the ability to run **tar** as root. We can use and abuse this to get the root flag.

[![Sudo](https://jarrodrizor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BountyHacker_lin_sudo.png)](https://jarrodrizor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BountyHacker_lin_sudo.png)

Navigating to [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/) we can find that we can become root by executing the following tar command.\
**sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh**

Let's run this **tar** command. We should now be root!

[![Root Flag](https://jarrodrizor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BountyHacker_RootFlag.png)](https://jarrodrizor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BountyHacker_RootFlag.png)

Now that we have root, we can **cat** the file and get the final flag!

That completes the room! If you found this helpful and learned something new, please send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/JarrodR87) and tell me what you thought! Feedback is always appreciated!
